## Introduction

A new Remix project containing all my remix UI challenges.
<br/>

## Composition

This starter kit is composed of:

- [Remix](http://remix.run)
  <br/>

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

## Warning
